I've been taking a little time to travel, spend time with my family, and read (mostly) trashy novels.

Also dabbling in front-end development again after almost a decade in the trenches doing orchestration and automation for a network services provider.
Wow, like the browser wars are over (or in remission at least) and css is almost wieldy!

Lately I'm hearing more and more the call of the workplace and all of its many joys and sorrows.
Here's a fresh copy of my [resume](/pdf/clark-trimble-cv.pdf) if you know of something that might be a good fit : )
