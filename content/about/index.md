# {{ metadata.author.name }}

I've been taking a little time to travel, enjoy my family, read (mostly) trashy novels, loiter in the best coffee shops, etc.

Also dabbling in front-end development again after almost a decade in the trenches doing orchestration and automation for a network services provider.
Wow, like the browser wars are over (or in remission at least) and css is almost wieldy!

Lately I'm hearing more and more the call of the workplace and all of its many joys and sorrows.

### [GitHub](https://github.com/clarktrimble)

Check it out; I'm starting to get some decent Golang posted!

### [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clark-trimble-50ab3012/)

Argha, must spruce up LinkedIn page ..

### Mastodon

Maybe I'll do this'n?

I'm curious to know if Mastodon/Fediverse/ActivityPub could support a recommendation network.
Say I recommend "All Systems Red" by Martha Wells and you like it as well, we might share some tastes, and might be interested in who the other follows.
Nothing earth shattering, but sans commercial interests and all the nerd-knobs at hand :)

## Résumé / Curriculum Vitae

Both names are a little awkward?
Either will do?
Seems like my friends outside the States go with CV, which I like the sound of.

Here's a fresh copy of [mine](/pdf/clark-trimble-cv.pdf) if you know of something that might be a good fit : )
