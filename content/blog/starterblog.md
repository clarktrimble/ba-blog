I write to you from an unconfigured vim in Windows Terminal.  So yeah, starter blog is scuff.
However, in the words of the incomparable Sia Karamalegos:

> Your blog isn't the goddess Athena. It's not going to pop fully formed and all grown up out of your head. You aren't Zeus.

Zow!!  So I cloned her starter repo and a few minutes later here we are.

## Random Walk

Unpacking that a little more, I knew (think) I wanted a static site generator and to publish via Netlify.
Probably some javascript in there somewhere..

### VitePress

It works!  It's not overweight.  I can customize it!?  Or can I?  Really a fine documentation site, for Vue stuffs.  Did I mention that I'm a recovering backend golang dev / architect?

### HUGO

Golang is good yeah?  Hugo is not Astro! (which I'm sure is great) B-but, maybe it is really.

### Eleventy

Cool name, and Zach Leatherman speaks! [The Need For Speed](https://thenewstack.io/the-need-for-speed-why-eleventy-leaves-bundlers-behind/)

Zold!

## Next Step(s)

* push to Netlify
* never edit Ba Blog on my gaming machine again
